# Redis

Redis is key-value in-memory data that is used for caching to improve the performance of the application. It provides a variety of data types for supporting multiple usecases. This post will give an overview of Redis's data structures and some tips&tricks when using them.

## Data structures
Redis has 9 data structures. The detailed information of these data types is documented in [Redis's document](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/).  Let's have a quick overview of them.
1. String: The simplest one. Though the name of the type is `string` , we can use math functions like `INCRBY`. 
2. List: stores list of strings in an `two way linked` list.
3. Set: stores list of unique items.
4. Hash: store a hash-map where the type of key and value is string, we should use hash to store structured data when possible.
5. Sorted set: like SET but the items in a sorted set is guaranteed in descending order based on the score of the item.
6. Streams: an append only data structure, Redis Stream provides pub/sub feature similar to Kafka. This post will not go to the detail of stream.
7. Geospatial: Store 2-D object, Redis provides `GEOSEARCH` to allow we to search near points of a given point.
8. Hypperloglog: A probabilistic-based data structure that is used to count a huge number of items. The popular usecase of hyperloglog is to count the number of unique views of a video/post. ([example](https://viblo.asia/p/analytic-cho-nguoi-nong-dan-bai-toan-dem-so-aWj53L0GK6m))
9. Bitmap: Like hashmap, but type of hash is binary (0/1)

## Best practices

1. Use hash when possible: As mentioned in [Redis document](https://redis.io/docs/management/optimization/memory-optimization/#use-hashes-when-possible) , when we have structured data, like user information, use hash is optimal in memory.
2. Length of a hash should be less than or equal to 512 by default: Redis server has `hash-zipmap-max-entries` with the default value is 512. When the length of the hash is less than or equal to 512, Redis will use ziplist to store the hash, otherwise, Redis will use a hash table to store the hash. The tradeoff here is CPU and RAM. Ziplist uses less memory (3-5 times smaller) but takes more CPU resource.  Here is two blogs post from [Instagram](https://instagram-engineering.com/storing-hundreds-of-millions-of-simple-key-value-pairs-in-redis-1091ae80f74c)and [peterbe](https://www.peterbe.com/plog/understanding-redis-hash-max-ziplist-entries) that describe the different between ziplist and hash table.
3. Use hcreby, creby when possible to avoid race condition. 
4. Use sorted set for quick pagination (on the first load of an API that return list of item by default order)
5. Diversify TTL value: we should prevent a large number of keys to expire at a same time, it would spam to the database, and reduce database performace. This issue is known as `thunder herd problem`
6. Set timeout: If the application follows the cache-aside pattern, we should set a timeout for the client in waiting for the Redis server's response. Because Redis is single thread, one slow query will affect other incoming queries, set a timeout will reduce the rate of that problem and improve the percentile of application.
7. Use pipeline to reduce the round-trip time.
